# Python Network Stress Tester

> ‚ö†Ô∏è For **educational use only**. Do not run this script against any system you do not explicitly own or have written permission to test.

---

## üìñ Description

This is a simple Python script that uses multi-threading and sockets to simulate repeated connections to a specified target IP and port. It's intended for **learning purposes only**, such as understanding how sockets and threading behave in Python, and how basic network stress tools work.

## üõ† Features

- Multi-threaded socket flooding
- Basic fake IP header (for simulation)
- Logs connection count
- Lightweight ‚Äî no dependencies beyond Python standard library

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Take-Off-7/Python-Authomation.git
cd Python-Authomation

2. Start a local HTTP server for testing:

To safely test the script without hitting external servers, run:
python -m http.server 80
This starts a simple HTTP server on your machine at:
http://127.0.0.1:80

3. Run the script:
In a different terminal, execute the stress test script:
python main.py
You should see output like:
Connections made: 500
Connections made: 1000
Connections made: 1500
...
This means the script is successfully opening many connections to your test server.
